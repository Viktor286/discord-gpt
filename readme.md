## Using bot in discord

To initialize a new chat thread, start your message with exclamation (!) character. The last message will be marked with emoji :hourglass_flowing_sand: meaning it's being rendered. In case of error it will change that mark into :construction:

Altering chat history:
You can delete bot massage by marking it with emoji :wastebasket: .
You also can delete your own messages by right-click discord controls.
